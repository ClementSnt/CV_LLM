I have almost 3 years of experience as a confirmed business analyst at Disneyland Paris, forecasting daily attendance and revenues for both parks and hotels, automating processes with Python and SQL, and conducting various studies to top management or commercial teams. 
Previously, I worked 2 years at Ubisoft as a financial planning analyst, forecasting costs for multiple departments and translation costs for games produced in EMEA and APAC.  
I also completed 6-month internships as a cost controller at Orange Cyberdefense and LNF.
